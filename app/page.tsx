          Cassetter is me, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dancroucher/">Dan Croucher</a> 
          I'm a creative and versatile video game producer and studio leader with 20+ years of hands-on game industry experience.<br>
          I've worked with big budgets and large teams, on a shoestring with tiny ones, and everything in-between. 
          I've shipped many commercially and critically acclaimed games across a large range of platforms, on time and on budget.<br>
          I pride myself on my drive, passion, attention to detail, straightforward approach and pursuit of quality - both at a game development and studio management level.
          <br>
